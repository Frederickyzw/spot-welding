### Brief Description
This project focuses on applying Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to optimize manufacturing processes, specifically in quality engineering. It explores the use of ANN in the inspection of casting products, identifying defects and ensuring product quality.
Key Features:

- ANN for Casting Product Inspection: Analyzes casting defects using a custom dataset of mechanical engineering components.
- Custom Dataset and YOLOv3 Model: Incorporates the YOLOv3 model for object detection, enhanced with a custom dataset to improve accuracy in detecting defects.

This implementation serves as a practical application of Machine Learning in Manufacturing, aimed at improving product inspection and quality control.
